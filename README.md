pony town info （＾Ｏ＾☆♪
- offtab usually, whisper me to interact
- ponies are free to take inspo from, idc about copying since the ponies i make don't matter that much to me. still, do avoid it and try making your own stuff, it feels more fulfilling than stealing the work of others
- i do not believe in tt/td and i don't wish to interact with anyone who thinks they have them in a pixel pony game. please go outside i beg of you
- either i don't play at all or i play 24/7, no in between
